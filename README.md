# User db api __ POC

I am refreshing myself in Rubyland by creating a user db api to be used in the context of mircroservices.

using:
  - docker
  - Ruby on Rails
  - Postgresql

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
